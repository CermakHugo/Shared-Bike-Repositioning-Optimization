## Description

This research project aims to optimise the rebalancing of bicycles in a self-service system. The aim is to propose models and algorithms to improve the availability of bicycles and free spaces in stations while minimising logistical costs.


## Objectives
The study aims to minimize unmet demand with the following objectives:

- Utilizes robust models to forecast short to medium-term station utilization by identifying daily trends and providing real-time or near-real-time estimates. 

- Develops and compares route-planning and capacity-allocation methods, including heuristics and genetic algorithms to effectively manage truck-based redistribution in response to station surpluses or deficits. 

- Assesses the necessary number of trucks and dispatch intervals while balancing operational costs, complexity, equity considerations, and feasibility within standard computational resources.

This paper predicts bike demand and optimizes rebalancing using historical and weather data. It uses MSWK for predicting pickups and ISBT for drop-offs. Rebalancing is solved with MINLP and clustering (AdaCCKC), grouping stations and assigning vehicles. MSWK and ISBT outperform baseline models, especially on weekends. Tested on NYC Citi Bike data, the method improves demand prediction and rebalancing.

This paper explores how bike share stations can be more effectively distributed across a city to improve accessibility and ensure both spatial and social equity. It points out that traditional designs, which tend to cluster stations in central areas, often fail to meet equity objectives. Although adding more stations does increase access and coverage, the results also show that the benefits level off compared to the rising costs highlighting the importance of planning that balances efficiency with fairness.

This paper predicts the number of bikes at each station using machine learning. Random Forest (RF) performs best, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.37 bikes/station, outperforming LSBoost and PLSR. Predictions are most accurate with a 15-minute horizon. Key features include station neighbors and weather (temperature, rain, humidity, wind, visibility). The study suggests adding memory (past availability) for future improvements.

This study shows that improving the efficiency of bike-sharing systems requires adapting bike repositioning strategies to meet daily demand variations. The researchers tested several strategies and found that those that use additional constraints (such as station imbalance or prediction error) are more effective at reducing bike shortages, especially when demand varies greatly. To determine which strategy to use, they created two indicators: RRPI (which measures inventory variations within the day) and SVUD (which measures shortage differences between stations). These two indices allow for classifying days according to the type of demand, and thus choosing the most appropriate strategy in advance. In short, the best strategy depends on the type of day, and this method allows for smarter, data-driven decisions.

This research developed a genetic algorithm to optimize location and capacity, an approach that can be adapt for repositioning for deciding where to install shared mobility hubs (cars, bicycles, electric scooters) in a large city like Amsterdam. The goal is to maximize benefits for users, while taking into account the available budget. The model shows that it is better to install several small, well-distributed hubs rather than a few large ones, in order to better cover the city and bring services closer to people. However, the study also reveals that without policies to limit car use (such as increasing parking costs), the environmental benefits remain low, as the majority of users instead abandon cycling or public transport in favor of these shared modes.
