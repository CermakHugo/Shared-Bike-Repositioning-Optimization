## Description

This research project aims to optimise the rebalancing of bicycles in a self-service system. The aim is to propose models and algorithms to improve the availability of bicycles and free spaces in stations while minimising logistical costs.


## Objectives

- Analyse the imbalance patterns of self-service bicycle stations.

- Develop mathematical and algorithmic models to optimise rebalancing.

- Test and validate the approaches using real data.

- Propose recommendations for improving the efficiency of existing systems.


## Technologies used

- Languages**: Python

- Main libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Scikit-learn

- Visualisation tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

- Optimisation**: PuLP, OR-Tools


## Data

Data used for this project includes:

- Open data from public bike systems.

- Historical bike flows between stations.

- Weather and event data that can influence demand.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ``bash

   git clone https://github.com/votre-utilisateur/optimisation-reequilibrage-velo.git

   cd optimisation-reequilibrage-velo

   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

   ``bash

   python -m venv

   source venv/bin/activate # (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```



## Usage

- Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the data and test the models.

- Use the `src/` folder to run the optimisation scripts and generate rebalancing recommendations.
