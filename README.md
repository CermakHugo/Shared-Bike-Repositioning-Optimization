## Description

This research project aims to optimise the rebalancing of bicycles in a self-service system. The aim is to propose models and algorithms to improve the availability of bicycles and free spaces in stations while minimising logistical costs.


## Objectives
The study aims to minimize unmet demand with the following objectives:

- Utilizes robust models to forecast short to medium-term station utilization by identifying daily trends and providing real-time or near-real-time estimates. 

- Develops and compares route-planning and capacity-allocation methods, including heuristics and genetic algorithms to effectively manage truck-based redistribution in response to station surpluses or deficits. 

- Assesses the necessary number of trucks and dispatch intervals while balancing operational costs, complexity, equity considerations, and feasibility within standard computational resources.

## Annotated Literature Review

- Machine Learning for Demand: Ashqar et al. (2020) developed random forest and boosting techniques to predict short-term bike availability. 

- Albuquerque et al. (2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in modeling station demand in dynamic environments. 

- Routing & Optimization: Liu et al. (2016) incorporated multi-source data for route planning, while Cho et al. (2021) emphasized how demand forecasts can minimize unmet demand. 

- Xanthopoulos et al. (2024) utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize location and capacity, an approach that can be adapt for repositioning. 

- Conrow et al. (2018) highlighted the importance of addressing coverage equity in system planning, which is conceptually significant for ensuring that no sub-region of the city is overlooked.
