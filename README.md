## Description

This research project aims to optimise the rebalancing of bicycles in a self-service system. The aim is to propose models and algorithms to improve the availability of bicycles and free spaces in stations while minimising logistical costs.


## Objectives
The study aims to minimize unmet demand with the following objectives:

- Utilizes robust models to forecast short to medium-term station utilization by identifying daily trends and providing real-time or near-real-time estimates. 

- Develops and compares route-planning and capacity-allocation methods, including heuristics and genetic algorithms to effectively manage truck-based redistribution in response to station surpluses or deficits. 

- Assesses the necessary number of trucks and dispatch intervals while balancing operational costs, complexity, equity considerations, and feasibility within standard computational resources.
